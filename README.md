# GraduateDesign

My Graduate Design which mainly modified ALO algorithm and cooperated with Apriori algorithm and Spark platform to mine association rules from given datasets.

THis project includes following parts:
  - PSO
  - ALO
  - MALO
  - MALO-Apriori
  - Spark-MALO-Apriori
  
 For the MALO algorithm, I modified following strategies:
  - Elitism
  - Elite Monitor
  - Random Walking
  - Repair Function
  
 The PSO was implemented to compare with proposed algorithm on solving same problems. The Experiment results showed that MALO series algorithm were much better than traditional PSO algorithm in front of association rules mining.
